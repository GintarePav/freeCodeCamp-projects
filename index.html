        This page contains links to the projects I've completed while taking
        courses on freeCodeCamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each project had a level of guidance because the creators of the course
        provided requirements of the features and elements that had to be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project also included test cases that also helped building the
        functionality.
