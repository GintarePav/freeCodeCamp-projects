# Project Overview
This repository contains all the JavaScript projects I have done on freeCodeCamp so far. For ease of access and easier sharing, I have downloaded my code from their website and created an additional page that takes the viewer to a selected project. Each project had a level of guidance because the creators of the course provided requirements of the features and elements that had to be used. The project also included test cases that also helped building the functionality.
