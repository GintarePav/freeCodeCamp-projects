# Introduction
This repository contains all the JavaScript projects I have done on _freeCodeCamp_ so far. For ease of access and easier sharing, I have downloaded my code from their website and created an additional page using _GitHub Pages_ that takes the viewer to a selected project. Each project on _freeCodeCamp_ has a level of guidance because the creators of the course provide requirements for the features and elements that have to be created. Each guided project also includes test cases that evaluate the level of correctness and project completion as well as prive help in building the functionality.

### Live Page
